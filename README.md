**Data-structures** are the building blocks of coding, the more you do it the
more you understand.In this repo I have tried to write a few commonplace
**algorithms** which reveals the importance of data-sturcture in programming.
Though I am using **Javascript** here but the algorithms are more or less 
language independent,moreover you can also find similiar data-structures in
almost all of the programming languages.So, our focus is to reduce the time 
& space complexities of the given solutions for the algorithm based problems.
Problems & solutions are given in Questions & Answers folders respectively.
